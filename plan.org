* Materials
** 3.3mm acryllic
** gjengstang M4 130mm
** 2x M4 locknuts (ca. 5.5mm thick)
* Electronics
** Raspberry Pi Model B+
Power usage: 0.5A - 1.0A [with keyboard, mouse and WiFi]
** Raspberry Pi Screen 5inch (7inch in a pinch),
Preferably with power- and hdmi-connectors on the longest side.
The 7" official screen has this, in addition to a separate driver board one can place anywhere.
A 5" screen as a Pi shield with a tiny hdmi jumper would be good, though.
Power usage: 0.5A ish says stackexchange
** ~2.1A powerbank
I have one that is 6700mAh
